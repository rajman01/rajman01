I’m a passionate software engineer who loves designing scalable systems, solving complex backend problems, and building products that empower businesses and people.  
I focus on **clean, maintainable, and production-ready** solutions across backend and cloud environments.  

## 🧠 About Me

- 💻 I specialize in **Golang**, **Node.js (TypeScript & JavaScript)**, and **microservice architectures**.  
- 🧩 Experienced in **building scalable APIs**, **real-time messaging systems**, and **background job infrastructures**.  
- ☁️ I deploy and manage applications using **Docker**, **DigitalOcean**, and **CI/CD pipelines**.  
- 🗄️ Strong experience with **MongoDB**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and **message queues**.  
- 💬 Skilled in **gRPC**, **REST**, and **event-driven systems**.  
- 🧭 Currently combining my **Surveying & Geoinformatics** background with software engineering to build **geospatial automation tools**.
- 🌐 Deeply exploring Web3 development, smart contracts, token standards, and decentralized architecture, highly interested in how blockchain can power secure, trustless financial and geospatial systems.
- 💡 Constantly learning, experimenting, and open to collaboration on impactful projects.
